# Design Ideas
Collection of system / network designs - and possibly blueprints - for apps I'd like to make some time.

I'm hoping to shape this into a small blog for easier viewing (for me) with tagging, but that's probably another design idea I'll do here.

I'm going to initially write some system design, and when saying "blueprint" I mean creating 'empty' services that can be as simple as just tiny containers and yaml files creating them.

## Blog

These will ideally be hosted as blog posts under my [blog](https://fabianswe.com/blog) (WIP).

The posts (denoted by `post.md` files) will be uploaded to a backing database, and the blog will be generated from that.
